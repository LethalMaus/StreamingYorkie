<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
Streaming Yorkie is designed to help <i>Twitch Streamers</i> to efficiently <i>Follow & Unfollow</i> other Streamers as well as offering a better overview of <i>Followers & Following</i>.
Automatically <i>Follow, Unfollow & F4F</i> simply by just installing and configuring Streaming Yorkie.
Helps build a bigger community by simplifying communication & freeing time to stream more.

<b>Guide</b>
https://github.com/LethalMaus/StreamingYorkie#guide

The code is <u><b>Open Source</b></u>, contains <u><b>no costs & no advertisements</b></u> are involved.
Streaming Yorkie is a gift back to a great community who I will continue to support for free.

Streaming Yorkie communicates exclusively with the <i>Twitch API</i>.
A login is required to be able to edit your <i>Followers & Following</i>.
Passwords are not saved, rather a unique Token given by Twitch is saved.
This ensures that your account is as safe as can be.

Streaming Yorkie was developed with <i>Android Studio</i> in <i>Java</i>.
<i>Lint</i> was used to acquire high quality code & the code itself is documented with <i>JavaDocs</i> & comments.
<b>DRY</b> <i>(Don't Repeat Yourself)</i> & <b>KISS</b> <i>(Keep It Simple Stupid)</i> principles are enforced as much as possible.
Variable naming conventions are in place.
The variable name must explain what it is or what it does, clearly, for any developer to understand.

Hopefully this can be used as an example for good coding as well as how to develop an Android App in Java.
Any collaborations are welcome, so feel free to fork & ask for merge requests.
See something inefficient? Let me know. I'm always trying to improve my code & learn new things.

Currently it is in an <b>Alpha</b> state. 
It could be that a <i>Bug</i> may appear or the app behaves in an unexpected manner.
Please report any problems or suspicions to help improve Streaming Yorkie for everyone.
