<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
Streaming Yorkie is designed to help <i>Twitch Streamers</i> to efficiently <i>Follow & Unfollow</i> other Streamers as well as offering a better overview of <i>Followers & Following</i>.
After your stream any <i>VOD (Video On Demand)</i> can be seen & exported to <i>Youtube</i> in our VOD Overview.
<b>Automatically Follow, Unfollow, F4F & export VODs to Youtube</b> simply by installing and configuring Streaming Yorkie.
Share that you are <b>AutoFollowing</b> to our Discord Community & gain more followers.
Helps build a bigger community, simplifies/automates communication, become an <i>affiliate</i> sooner & helps free up time to stream more.
Watch multiple streams at once on one screen with <b>Multi View</b>.
<b>Lurk</b> your favourite streamers with little network usage (audio only) & add to their view count.

Currently it is in an <b>Alpha</b> state.
It could be that a <i>Bug</i> may appear or the app behaves in an unexpected manner.
Please report any problems or suspicions to help improve Streaming Yorkie for everyone.

<b>Guide</b>
https://github.com/LethalMaus/StreamingYorkie#guide

The code is <u><b>Open Source</b></u>, contains <u><b>no costs & no advertisements</b></u> are involved.
It is a gift back to a great community who I will continue to support for <b>free</b>.

Streaming Yorkie communicates exclusively with the <i>Twitch API</i>, <i>Twitch Website</i> & <i>Twitch Multi View</i>.
A login is required to be able to edit & see your Twitch data.
Passwords are not saved, rather a unique Token given by Twitch is saved.
This ensures that your account is as safe as can be.
VOD exports are done by Twitch. VODs are not downloaded & uploaded by Streaming Yorkie
This ensure data usage is kept to a minimum.

Streaming Yorkie was developed with <i>Android Studio</i> in <i>Java</i>.
<i>Lint</i> was used to acquire high quality standardized code with little complexity & the code itself is documented with <i>JavaDocs</i> & comments.
<b>DRY</b> <i>(Don't Repeat Yourself)</i> & <b>KISS</b> <i>(Keep It Simple Stupid)</i> principles are enforced as much as possible.
Variable naming conventions are in place.
The variable name must explain what it is or what it does, clearly, for any developer to understand.

Hopefully this can be used as an example for good coding as well as how to develop an Android App in Java.
Any collaborations are welcome, so feel free to fork & ask for merge requests.
See something inefficient? Let me know. I'm always trying to improve my code & learn new things.
