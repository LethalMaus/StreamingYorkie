<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
Streaming Yorkie is a tool designed to help <i>Twitch Streamers</i> to efficiently <i>Follow & Unfollow</i> other Streamers
The tool offers a better overview of <i>Followers, Following, Unfollowed & F4F</i>
After your stream any <i>VOD (Video On Demand)</i> can be seen & exported to <i>Youtube</i> in our VODs Overview
<b>Automatically Follow, Unfollow, F4F, Lurk & export VODs to Youtube</b> simply by installing and configuring Streaming Yorkie
Share that you are <b>AutoFollowing</b> to our Discord Community & gain more followers
Helps build a bigger community, simplifies/automates communication to become an <i>affiliate</i> or <i>partner</i> faster & free up time to stream more
Watch multiple streams at once with <b>Multi View</b> and cast it to a TV
<b>Lurk</b> your favourite streamers with minimum possible network data usage (audio only & chat) & increase their viewer count
Use our Discord to get others to to Follow or Lurk and gain more viewers. Use the F4F L4L H4H Channel

Currently it is in an <b>Alpha</b> state
It could be that a <i>Bug</i> may appear or the app behaves in an unexpected manner
Please report any problems or suspicions to help improve Streaming Yorkie for everyone

<b>Guide</b>
https://github.com/LethalMaus/StreamingYorkie#guide

The code is <u><b>Open Source</b></u>, contains <u><b>no costs & no advertisements</b></u> are involved
It is a gift back to a great community who I will continue to support for <b>free</b>

Streaming Yorkie communicates exclusively with the <i>Twitch API</i>, <i>Twitch Website</i> & <i>Twitch Multi View</i>
A login is required to be able to edit & see your Twitch data
Passwords are not seen or saved, rather a unique Token given by Twitch is used after the login
This ensures that your account is as safe as can be
All data is saved locally & only you have access to it
VOD exports are done by Twitch, they are not downloaded & uploaded by Streaming Yorkie
This ensures network data usage is kept to a minimum
A PircBotX bot is used to send a message to a lurked channel on demand or automatically

Streaming Yorkie is developed with <i>Android Studio</i> in <i>Java</i>
<i>Lint</i> & <i>Sonarcloud</i> is used to acquire high quality standardized code while little complexity
The code is documented with <i>JavaDocs</i> & comments to allow for easier collaborations with other developers
<b>DRY</b> <i>(Don't Repeat Yourself)</i> & <b>KISS</b> <i>(Keep It Simple Stupid)</i> principles are enforced as much as possible
Variable naming conventions are also in place
The variable name must explain what it is or what it does, clearly, for any developer to understand

Hopefully this can be used as an example for good coding as well as how to develop an Android App in Java
Any collaborations are welcome, so feel free to fork & ask for merge requests
See something inefficient? Let me know. I'm always trying to improve my coding & learn new things
